# solc-js demo
A demo project to compile a solidity smart contract just using `solc-js`.

We don't need that big fat Hardhat or Truffle for just compiling a contrcat!

## Run a demo
First clone this repository.

```sh
npm ci
npx ts-node index.ts
```

You'll get compiled bytecode and ABI json for `sample.sol` contract.
